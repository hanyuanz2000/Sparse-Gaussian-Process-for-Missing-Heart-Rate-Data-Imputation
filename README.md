# Gaussian Process Regression to Predict Heart Rate 

We intend to use Gaussian process regression to predict a set of heart rate time series data from the MIT-BIH dataset (1000 observations as the training set and 500 observations as the test set). We are going to use three sparse Gaussian process methods: SKI/KISS GP, Scalable Kernel Learning by Stochastic Lanczos Expansions, and Constant time predictive distributions on the dataset. We will evaluate above methods with their accuracy and computing efficiency.

This branch is for implement ski/kiss gaussian process model
