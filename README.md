# TimeSeriesProject

First, we intend to use Gaussian process regression to predict a set of heart rate time series data from the MIT-BIH dataset (1000 observations as the training set and 500 observations as the test set). 
Moreover, we are going to try to predict the heart rate using three sparse Gaussian process methods: SKI/KISS GP, Scalable Kernel Learning by Stochastic Lanczos Expansions, Constant time predictive distributions on the same dataset and the results of the three methods will be compared with each other. The time cost and accuracy of the different methods will be the main measure by which we evaluate these methods.
