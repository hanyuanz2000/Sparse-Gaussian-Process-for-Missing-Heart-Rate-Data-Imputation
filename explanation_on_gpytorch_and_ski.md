##why we are going to use gpytorch
First in contrast to many existing GP packages, we do not provide full GP models for the user. Rather, we provide the tools necessary to quickly construct one. This is because we believe, analogous to building a neural network in standard PyTorch, it is important to have the flexibility to include whatever components are necessary. As can be seen in more complicated examples, this allows the user great flexibility in designing custom models.
